# Computer Vision Exercises 

These are the exercises proposed during the course [Computer Vision](https://corsi.unige.it/en/off.f/2022/ins/60227?codcla=10635) held at [University of Genova (UniGe), Itlay](https://unige.it/en) in [M.Sc Robotics Engineering](https://corsi.unige.it/en/corsi/10635).  

The folder **Lab-02** focused on the methods to add different types of noise, filters and applying Fourier transformation to the sample image. Using MATLAB appropriate approach is applied on the sample image provided during the lab and the changes are observed with the image.

The folder **Lab-05** focuses on Normalized cross-correlation and Harris corner detection. The NCC focuses on keypoints or corners of the image. Harris corner detection focuses on the corner, edge and plane detec- tion.
